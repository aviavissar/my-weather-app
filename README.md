# wheather app 
## fetch city wheather from api and display the week days and favorites

### The requirements

1. Create a header with navigation icons/links/buttons for main and favorites screen. 
2. The main screen (weather details) will be composed of a search field to search a location’s weather by city name. And below it, the current weather and a 5-day forecast of the searched location. A location should have an indication if it’s already saved in favorites, and a button to add/remove from favorites (it can be the same button).
3. Display Tel Aviv weather by default. 
4. Favorites screen will be composed of a list of favorite locations. Each location should have an ID, name and current weather. Clicking on a favorite will navigate to the main screen showing the details of that location. 
5. Searching should be done in English letters only 
6. State management is a must! 
7. Responsive design is a must! (flexbox/grid will give you extra points ��).
8. Error handling is a must! (can be done with toast, modal).
